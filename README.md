India spends over ₹70,000 crores every year on agricultural input subsidies such as fertilizers, seeds, and farming equipment. However, a significant portion of these subsidies does not reach genuine farmers.

Leakage occurs due to:

Ghost farmers created with fake identities or mismatched land records

Black-market diversion where dealers issue subsidized fertilizers/seeds to non-farmers

Over-claiming subsidies by farmers whose actual landholding is smaller than what is declared

Manipulation of land documents and lack of real-time verification

Absence of unified, verified farmer identity, making it easy to duplicate or misuse farmer profiles

Delayed audits that detect fraud only after the season is over

The government currently lacks a centralized system to authenticate farmers, verify land ownership, track subsidy transactions, or detect suspicious patterns across districts and dealer networks.

The core problem:
India needs an intelligent, verifiable, real-time system that links farmer identity, land records, and subsidy transactions — and can automatically detect anomalies and potential fraud before the subsidy is misused.

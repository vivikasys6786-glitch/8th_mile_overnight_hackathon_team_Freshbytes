India spends over ₹70,000 crores every year on agricultural input subsidies such as fertilizers, seeds, and farming equipment. However, a significant portion of these subsidies does not reach genuine farmers.

Leakage occurs due to:

Ghost farmers created with fake identities or mismatched land records

Black-market diversion where dealers issue subsidized fertilizers/seeds to non-farmers

Over-claiming subsidies by farmers whose actual landholding is smaller than what is declared

Manipulation of land documents and lack of real-time verification

Absence of unified, verified farmer identity, making it easy to duplicate or misuse farmer profiles

Delayed audits that detect fraud only after the season is over

The government currently lacks a centralized system to authenticate farmers, verify land ownership, track subsidy transactions, or detect suspicious patterns across districts and dealer networks.

The core problem:
India needs an intelligent, verifiable, real-time system that links farmer identity, land records, and subsidy transactions — and can automatically detect anomalies and potential fraud before the subsidy is misused.
## key features of your solution
1. E-Farmer ID (EFN) – Unified Digital Farmer Identity

A unique, secure digital ID linked with Aadhaar (conceptually), family ration card, and verified land records to eliminate ghost farmers.

2. Verified Land & Ownership Profile

Includes GPS coordinates, land area, FMB sketch details, and tehsildar-certified records to prevent fake or inflated land claims.

3. Entitlement-Based Subsidy Limits

Automatic calculation of allowed fertilizer/seed quantity based on land size, crop type, soil characteristics, rainfall zone, and region.

4. Dealer Transaction Logging

Every subsidy issue (fertilizer/seed) is digitally recorded against the farmer’s EFN, enabling complete traceability and preventing black-market diversion.

5. Real-Time Fraud & Anomaly Detection

Rule-based detection highlights suspicious patterns such as oversized claims, duplicate usage, abnormal dealer behavior, and clustered ghost entries.

6. AI-Based Land Verification (Prototype)

Farmers upload land photos with GPS metadata; neighbour cross-validation and AI checks help confirm crop type, soil consistency, and real farming activity.

7. Officer Dashboard & Alerts

A centralized dashboard shows total farmers, subsidy issued, suspicious alerts, risk scores, and dealer anomalies for fast decision-making.
